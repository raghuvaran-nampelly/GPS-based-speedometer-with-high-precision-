GPS-Based Speedometer: A modern alternative to traditional wheel-based speedometers using the Neo-6M GPS module, Arduino, and OLED display. Unlike conventional systems, which depend on wheel rotation and can be affected by tire wear, this GPS-based solution provides accurate, real-time speed data by tracking vehicle position over time
